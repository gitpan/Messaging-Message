Messaging-Message

Messaging-Message is a set of Perl modules useful to deal with
"messages", as used in messaging, see for instance:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_messaging_system.

The modules include a transport independent message abstraction, a
versatile message generator and several message queues/spools to
locally store messages.

A Python implementation of the same messaging abstractions is
available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/messaging/ so messaging
components can be written in different programming languages.
